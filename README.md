Pig-Latin-Translator
====================

Sentences can be translated from English to Pig Latin by applying a set of rules to each word in the sentence. The rules are as follows:  If the word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster, move the consonant(s) to the end of the word and append ay (e.g. happy becomes appyhay, child becomes ildchay).  If the word begins with a vowel append way to the end of the word (e.g. egg becomes eggway).
